# DecodePolyline
Hello all, here I present to you my first App Inventor extension ever made for decoding polylines from Google Maps API. First, I found the Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format and tried to reverse it using blocks, but then I found the <a href="http://jeffreysambells.com/">Jeffrey Sambells' method</a> and I felt like learning how to make an extension.

So this is it! I hope you find this useful and you find how to make it better, please let me know so I can learn from it.

This extension was made in colaboration with Diego Pedroza.
